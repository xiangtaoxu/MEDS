"""meds.plant — a Pythonic front end to the MEDS plant-ecophysiology model (libmeds_plant_c).

The plant module goes beyond a single leaf process, so it is split into submodules (one per process
family), all backed by the one plant C-API shared library:

    meds.plant.leaf   — leaf gas exchange: FvCB C3 / Collatz C4 photosynthesis + Leuning / Medlyn /
                        Katul stomatal conductance, Arrhenius / peaked temperature response, and the
                        coupled A-gs-Ci solver.
    meds.plant.pheno  — leaf phenology: the signal kernel that emits the two per-day flush / shed
                        rate tendencies from environmental cues + per-PFT traits.

Both are exposed with dataclasses + enums so callers never touch ctypes:

    import meds.plant.leaf as leaf
    flux = leaf.gas_exchange(par=1500.0, leaf_temp=298.15, vpd=1000.0, ca=400.0, params=leaf.c3_params())

    import meds.plant.pheno as pheno
    ph = pheno.Phenology(pheno.temperate_deciduous())
    out = ph.step(temp_day=290.0, daylength=13.0, doy=150)

Importing `meds.plant` is cheap; the compiled library (see meds.plant._ffi) loads lazily on first use.
