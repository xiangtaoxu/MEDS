"""meds.demography — Python companion for the Fortran demographic engine.

Loads ``libmeds_c.so`` (built with ``-DMEDS_BUILD_PYLIB=ON``) and drives the
standalone carbon slow loop through the C-API, reading cohort/patch state back
into numpy. Importing this submodule loads the shared library; ``import meds``
alone does not.
