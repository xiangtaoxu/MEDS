# Census preparation: a ForestGEO tree table to a MEDS census

[`make_census.py`](make_census.py) turns one census of a ForestGEO plot into the file MEDS reads with
`[init].init_mode = 1`. It only maps trees to patches:

- each square plot cell, of side `cell_size`, is one patch, with `patch_area` its true area;
- each distinct (cell, diameter) is one row, with `nplant` the number of those trees over the area.

It does no binning and no fusion. MEDS restructures the stand before the first step with the slow
step's own operators (`docs/configuration.md`, "How a run starts"), so the census can carry every
measured size and every cell.

```bash
python make_census.py --declaration ../../examples/example_flux_tower_bci/bci_census.toml \
    --out ../../examples/example_flux_tower_bci/data/bci_census2010_meds.csv
```

The declaration TOML names the table, its checksum and how to read it (`[source]`), the plot and the
cell size (`[plot]`), and optionally a MEDS PFT file (`[pft]`) and an earlier census
(`[mortality]`). With those two, the summary JSON also carries the stand's steady-state litter input
for `[soil_carbon].spinup_steady`: leaf and fine-root turnover from the PFT, and wood from the plot's
observed biomass mortality between the two censuses, routed as MEDS routes necromass.

| Kept | Dropped, and counted in the summary |
|---|---|
| status `A`, a diameter of at least `min_dbh_mm`, coordinates inside the plot | every other status, live trees without a diameter, smaller trees, trees outside the plot |

A grid that does not tile the plot, such as 40 m cells on a 500 m side, ends in partial cells, and
each keeps its true area. The tool warns about cells with no kept tree, whose area is lost to the
site.

Dependencies: numpy, pandas; pyreadr for `.rdata` tables; tomli on Python < 3.11. Tests:
`python -m pytest scripts/prepare_census/tests`, also run by CTest as `prepare_census`.
