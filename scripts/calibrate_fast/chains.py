"""The state chains (MEDS_FAST_CALIBRATION_BEST_PRACTICE.md §6.1).

Every window has its own chain: a frozen run from the initial stand (the base config's census or
state) that starts `chain_lead_days` before the window and writes a state at its start. Every trial
of that window restarts from it, so the soil water and temperature a window starts with are the
model's own, not the census's initialization. A chain runs with one set of key values (the start's,
and again the fit's at the refresh); a chain already run with the same values is reused.
